## Our Tech
We utilise Next.js, Tailwind and Slint for our frontend, with a backend in Express.js and MongoDB. Our smart contracts are done in Solidity, and we interact with them through infrastructure provided by Infura.

## What we solve
Our project aims to address a pressing issue within the healthcare industry: medical prescription fraud. With the increasing reliance on digital records and prescriptions, the vulnerability to fraudulent activities has become a significant concern. To combat this, we are leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent system for managing medical prescriptions.

Traditional prescription systems are susceptible to various forms of fraud, including unauthorized alterations, duplicate prescriptions, and even counterfeit medications. These fraudulent activities not only jeopardize patient safety but also strain healthcare resources and erode trust in the system.

By harnessing the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain, our solution provides a comprehensive defense against prescription fraud. Each prescription is securely recorded on the blockchain, creating a tamper-proof and transparent audit trail. This ensures the integrity of the prescription data from the moment it is issued by the healthcare provider to the point of fulfillment by the pharmacy.
